## These are the files for the sixth OSU Web Development Bootcamp Homework Assignment

Here is a [link](https://pjdip.github.io/Philip-DiPaula-OSU-bootcamp-hwk6/) to the live page :D

The goal of this assignment was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day using dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. We needed to incorporate the moment.js library in order to add functionality involving time.

## Installation

The only thing you will need to have installed in order to run the index.html file is a functioning web browser. It should work with most versions of most browswers. I recommend the Brave browser, as you will be paid in the Basic Attention Token (BAT) for viewing ads, instead of being bombarded with ads and getting nothing for it. The webpage will require access to the localStorage on your browser in order to save events properly.

## Usage 

In order to use this project, simply open the index.html in your favorite browser or open the link provided above. You will find the date and time displayed near the top of the page and the calendary with the work hours of the day following. In order to save an event, simply click into the text area and type what you want, then hit the save button to the right of that same area. Your content will remain when you reload the page. You are able to alter it as you desire and save the new content in the same way as before. Depending on the time of day, each text area will have different colors to denote whether it is the current (red), past (grey), or future (green) hour.
